## üìè Effect Size Guidelines

### Cohen's Effect Size Standards

| Effect Size | Small | Medium | Large |
|-------------|-------|--------|-------|
| **Cohen's d** | 0.2 | 0.5 | 0.8 |
| **Cohen's f** | 0.1 | 0.25 | 0.4 |
| **Cohen's w** | 0.1 | 0.3 | 0.5 |
| **Correlation r** | 0.1 | 0.3 | 0.5 |

### Practical Interpretation

**Small Effects (0.1-0.3)**:
- Subtle differences
- May require large sample sizes
- Often clinically meaningful despite small magnitude

**Medium Effects (0.3-0.5)**:
- Moderate differences
- Balance between detectability and practical significance
- Most common target in research

**Large Effects (0.5+)**:
- Substantial differences
- Easier to detect with smaller samples
- May indicate strong interventions or clear relationships

## üéØ Study Design Considerations

### Sample Size Planning

1. **Primary Outcome**: Base sample size on primary endpoint
2. **Multiple Comparisons**: Adjust for multiple testing
3. **Attrition**: Plan for expected dropout rates
4. **Subgroup Analysis**: Ensure adequate power for subgroups

### Power Analysis Strategy

1. **Define Effect Size**: Use literature, pilot data, or clinical judgment
2. **Set Alpha Level**: Typically 0.05 (adjust for multiple comparisons)
3. **Choose Power**: 80% minimum, 90% preferred for important studies
4. **Consider Practical Constraints**: Budget, time, participant availability

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Underpowered Studies**: Insufficient sample size for meaningful effects
2. **Overpowered Studies**: Unnecessarily large samples for trivial effects
3. **Ignoring Assumptions**: Failing to verify test assumptions
4. **Multiple Testing**: Not adjusting for multiple comparisons

### Best Practices

1. **Pilot Studies**: Use pilot data to estimate effect sizes
2. **Literature Review**: Base effect sizes on similar studies
3. **Clinical Input**: Consult with clinical experts on meaningful differences
4. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Test sample size across range of effect sizes
5. **Documentation**: Clearly document power analysis assumptions
