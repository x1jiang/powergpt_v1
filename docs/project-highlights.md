### AI Workflow Example

```
User Query: "I need sample size for comparing two groups with 0.5 difference, SD of 1.0, and 80% power"

AI Processing:
1. Identifies: Two-sample t-test
2. Extracts: delta=0.5, sd=1.0, power=0.8
3. Calls: PowerGPT API
4. Returns: 64 participants per group
5. Explains: Test purpose, assumptions, interpretation

Final Response: "For your two-sample t-test comparing two independent groups, you'll need 64 participants per group (128 total) to detect a difference of 0.5 with 80% power, assuming a standard deviation of 1.0. This test is appropriate when comparing means between two independent groups, such as treatment vs. control in a randomized trial."
